A few reasons behind the change.\nWhy Congo? #Fresh look. Sometimes you just want something new. Compose served us well, but we felt like trying a different aesthetic direction.\nMultilingual support. Congo has first-class i18n support with per-language config files. As the project grows, we want the site to be accessible in more than one language.\nDark purple palette. Congo\u0026rsquo;s default dark appearance leans into deep violet tones — and that happens to match the mood we\u0026rsquo;re going for. We\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about the project\u0026rsquo;s visual identity: dark purple and blue on a white background, with bright pops of red-pink and cyan-blue as accents.\nMascot idea #We\u0026rsquo;re also toying with the idea of a project mascot — a catgirl sorceress in dark violet robes, wearing a druid\u0026rsquo;s hood with glowing pink eyes peeking out from underneath, holding a magic staff. Purely a concept for now, but it fits the vibe. A proper brand book is on the to-do list.\nExamples of Congo in the wild #If you want to see what the theme looks like on real sites:\nCongo demo — the official theme demo leif.io — personal site and tech blog major.io — personal site and blog softwarewitchcraft.com — personal blog gorbe.io — business site and blog You can find the full list of sites using Congo on the theme\u0026rsquo;s users page.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/switching-to-congo/","section":"Blog","summary":"We switched our site theme from Compose to Congo — here\u0026rsquo;s why.","title":"Switching to Congo"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/theme/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Theme"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
