Dark mode, language switching, navigation — nothing broke, and it all looks clean and modern.\nOne small detail #There\u0026rsquo;s something that has always puzzled me: why do the vast majority of themes default to left-aligned text? The right edge of paragraphs ends up ragged, and it looks sloppy — especially on wide screens where the lines are long and the unevenness is hard to miss.\nJustified text makes everything feel tighter and more intentional — like a book or a well-typeset magazine. Sure, justify has its quirks with hyphenation, but for a blog with reasonable line lengths it looks significantly better.\nHow we fixed it #Congo provides an assets/css/custom.css file for user styles — it\u0026rsquo;s loaded automatically and isn\u0026rsquo;t touched during theme updates. A single rule is all it takes:\n.prose { text-align: justify; } Done. Text is now justified, and the next Congo update won\u0026rsquo;t break anything.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/first-impressions/","section":"Blog","summary":"Congo works great out of the box, but one small detail needed a manual fix.","title":"First impressions of the new theme"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"Welcome to SigilGate — an open-source organization building tools and templates for the modern web.\nExplore our blog for updates, guides, and technical deep-dives.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/","section":"SigilGate","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to \u003cstrong\u003eSigilGate\u003c/strong\u003e — an open-source organization building tools and templates for the modern web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplore our \n      \n    \u003ca href=\"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e for updates, guides, and technical deep-dives.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"SigilGate"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/site/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Site"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/theme/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Theme"},{"content":"We\u0026rsquo;ve switched the SigilGate site from the Compose theme to Congo. A few reasons behind the change.\nWhy Congo? #Fresh look. Sometimes you just want something new. Compose served us well, but we felt like trying a different aesthetic direction.\nMultilingual support. Congo has first-class i18n support with per-language config files. As the project grows, we want the site to be accessible in more than one language.\nDark purple palette. Congo\u0026rsquo;s default dark appearance leans into deep violet tones — and that happens to match the mood we\u0026rsquo;re going for. We\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about the project\u0026rsquo;s visual identity: dark purple and blue on a white background, with bright pops of red-pink and cyan-blue as accents.\nMascot idea #We\u0026rsquo;re also toying with the idea of a project mascot — a catgirl sorceress in dark violet robes, wearing a druid\u0026rsquo;s hood with glowing pink eyes peeking out from underneath, holding a magic staff. Purely a concept for now, but it fits the vibe. A proper brand book is on the to-do list.\nExamples of Congo in the wild #If you want to see what the theme looks like on real sites:\nCongo demo — the official theme demo leif.io — personal site and tech blog antoinesoetewey.com — personal site major.io — personal site and blog softwarewitchcraft.com — personal blog gorbe.io — business site and blog You can find the full list of sites using Congo on the theme\u0026rsquo;s users page.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/switching-to-congo/","section":"Blog","summary":"We switched our site theme from Compose to Congo — here\u0026rsquo;s why.","title":"Switching to Congo"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
