This is the cross-border channel: it crosses the perimeter where DPI systems focus their attention.\nVLESS over gRPC is a strong combination. The traffic is virtually indistinguishable from regular HTTPS: TLS with a valid certificate, HTTP/2, browser-like TLS fingerprint. From the outside, it looks like a request to an ordinary web service. Identifying it by signatures is practically impossible.\nBut \u0026ldquo;virtually indistinguishable\u0026rdquo; does not mean \u0026ldquo;impossible to detect.\u0026rdquo;\nEven when the traffic content is encrypted and the protocol is obfuscated, metadata remains: who, where, how often, how long. A persistent connection to the same gRPC path on the same host is a pattern. Even for a legitimate gRPC microservice, this looks suspicious — real services typically call different endpoints.\nIf the path doesn\u0026rsquo;t change for weeks, it becomes a marker. Statistical analysis can single out such a connection from the general traffic flow.\nThe solution: rotate the gRPC serviceName automatically at a set interval. Each new path is a randomly generated string. From the outside, it looks like activity from various services and users on the same host.\nI\u0026rsquo;d been putting off the implementation for a while, but today I finally got around to it.\nIn its minimal form, it\u0026rsquo;s a bash script on the core node, triggered by a systemd timer. The script generates a new random path, updates the Nginx and Xray configs on the core node, then pushes the outbound path change to each entry node over SSH.\nAn important detail: the client-facing side is not affected. The path is rotated only on the internal entry→core segment. Clients don\u0026rsquo;t need to reconfigure anything — they keep connecting to the entry node at the same address as before.\nCurrent limitations #For a few seconds during rotation, the connection may drop — services are restarted. The client reconnects automatically, but the interruption is noticeable.\nIn the future, we plan to switch to the Xray gRPC API (hot reload). This will allow path changes without restarting services — making the rotation seamless, with no connection drops.\nCurrently, rotation is set to run every hour. Practice will show whether this causes any noticeable inconvenience on the client side. If not, we\u0026rsquo;ll increase the interval or move rotation to periods of least activity.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-grpc-%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B9/","section":"Blog","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s been on the roadmap for a while — and it\u0026rsquo;s finally done.

Dark mode, language switching, navigation — nothing broke, and it all looks clean and stylish.\nOne small detail #There\u0026rsquo;s something that has always puzzled me: why do the vast majority of themes default to left-aligned text? Why? Just\u0026hellip; why?! Oh, for the love of — my inner perfectionist suffers every time I see a crisp edge on the left and a ragged, uneven zigzag of line endings on the right. What\u0026rsquo;s stopping us from setting proper rules and boundaries for text blocks? It looks really sloppy — especially on wide screens where the lines are long and the unevenness is hard to miss.\nJustified text makes everything feel tighter and more intentional — like a book or a well-typeset magazine. Sure, justify has its quirks with hyphenation, but\u0026hellip; justified alignment is undoubtedly my choice.\nHow to fix it #Congo provides an assets/css/custom.css file for user styles — it\u0026rsquo;s loaded automatically and isn\u0026rsquo;t touched during theme updates. A single rule is all it takes:\n.prose { text-align: justify; } Done.

Hugo, of course — minimalist and fast. I\u0026rsquo;ve accumulated some experience with it on other projects. If I ever need to dig into its internals and fix something — it won\u0026rsquo;t be a big deal.\nHowever, choosing a theme is a different story entirely. Design, personal taste, creative agony — the choice is never easy. In the end, after reviewing quite a few options, I settled on Congo. Here are a few reasons.\nWhy Congo? #Fresh look. Sometimes you just want something new. The previous theme worked fine for me: it was clean and suited for documentation. But here I wanted more room for creativity. After all, this is meant to be half personal blog, even if with a professional slant.\nMultilingual support. Congo has first-class i18n support with per-language config files. I try to build multilingual support into all of my projects — it helps me maintain and practice my English. Besides — who knows what region or audience this project might reach in the future?\nDark theme out of the box. Congo\u0026rsquo;s default dark appearance leans into deep violet tones — and that happens to match the mood I\u0026rsquo;m in right now.\nMascot idea #I have an idea for a project mascot — a catgirl sorceress. Purple hair, dark violet robes and a druid\u0026rsquo;s hood with glowing pink eyes peeking out from underneath. A magic staff in hand, bearing Sigil Gate\u0026rsquo;s signature symbols (I have a few ideas on how to use it as a logo). Purely a concept for now, but it fits the vibe. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about the project\u0026rsquo;s visual identity: dark purple and blue on a white background, with bright pops of red-pink and cyan-blue as accents (a proper brand book is on the to-do list).\nExamples of Congo in the wild #If you want to see what the theme looks like on real sites:\nCongo demo — the official theme demo leif.io — personal site and tech blog antoinesoetewey.com — personal site major.io — personal site and blog softwarewitchcraft.com — personal blog gorbe.io — business site and blog You can find the full list of sites using Congo on the theme\u0026rsquo;s users page.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/choosing-a-theme-for-the-sigil-gate-project/","section":"Blog","summary":"Congo as the site theme — choosing, installing, and explaining why.","title":"Choosing a theme for the Sigil Gate project"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/linux/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linux"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/systemd/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Systemd"},{"content":"I feel like a caveman.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been around for a while, and there are things I\u0026rsquo;ve grown so accustomed to that I treat them as constants. They\u0026rsquo;re always in their place. They always work. I never wonder if there\u0026rsquo;s something else — because why would I, if everything\u0026rsquo;s fine as it is?\nWhen I need to run something on a regular schedule — I use cron. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how old this utility is. It feels like it\u0026rsquo;s been around forever. Open crontab -e, write a schedule, forget about it. It works.\nBut today, while solving yet another periodic task, I was surprised to discover that an alternative exists. And has existed for quite some time.\nSystemd timer is a task scheduling mechanism built into systemd. It solves the same problems as cron, but with greater precision and more options:\nSecond-level granularity. Cron\u0026rsquo;s minimum interval is one minute. Systemd timer has no such limitation. No duplicate runs. If the previous run hasn\u0026rsquo;t finished yet, a new one won\u0026rsquo;t start. Cron doesn\u0026rsquo;t control this: if a script runs longer than the interval, a second instance launches on top of the first. Logging via journalctl. All runs, outputs, errors — in one place. No need to manually redirect stdout to a file. RandomizedDelaySec. Random delay for the start time. The task doesn\u0026rsquo;t fire exactly on schedule — it starts at a random moment within a defined window. This makes timing patterns harder to detect — useful when predictability is undesirable. Dependencies. You can specify that a task should only run after the network is up, after another service has started, after a disk is mounted. Cron just fires on schedule, regardless of system state (or you have to cobble together your own workarounds). Persistent. If the system was off when a scheduled run was due, the task runs immediately after boot. Cron simply loses missed runs. Recently I needed to set up automatic rotation of randomly generated gRPC paths between nodes. I could have used cron for this. But\u0026hellip; I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to leave the cave.\nNow that I know about systemd timer, here\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s on the agenda:\nSet up monitoring via journalctl — alerts on rotation errors, log aggregation. Fine-tune the random delay — to make statistical analysis of rotation timing even harder for detection systems. Network dependency — don\u0026rsquo;t attempt rotation if the network hasn\u0026rsquo;t come up yet after a reboot. And possibly more things that systemd timer can do and cron can\u0026rsquo;t. I suspect I\u0026rsquo;ve only scratched the surface.
