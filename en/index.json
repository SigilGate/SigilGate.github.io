Dark mode, language switching, navigation — nothing broke, and it all looks clean and stylish.\nOne small detail #There\u0026rsquo;s something that has always puzzled me: why do the vast majority of themes default to left-aligned text? Why? Just\u0026hellip; why?! Oh, for the love of — my inner perfectionist suffers every time I see a crisp edge on the left and a ragged, uneven zigzag of line endings on the right. What\u0026rsquo;s stopping us from setting proper rules and boundaries for text blocks? It looks really sloppy — especially on wide screens where the lines are long and the unevenness is hard to miss.\nJustified text makes everything feel tighter and more intentional — like a book or a well-typeset magazine. Sure, justify has its quirks with hyphenation, but\u0026hellip; justified alignment is undoubtedly my choice.\nHow to fix it #Congo provides an assets/css/custom.css file for user styles — it\u0026rsquo;s loaded automatically and isn\u0026rsquo;t touched during theme updates. A single rule is all it takes:\n.prose { text-align: justify; } Done. Text is now justified, and the next Congo update won\u0026rsquo;t break anything.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/first-impressions-of-the-new-theme/","section":"Blog","summary":"Congo works great out of the box, but\u0026hellip;","title":"First impressions of the new theme"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"Building tunnels, bridging gaps, connecting countries and continents.\nLearn more...

Hugo, of course — minimalist and fast. I\u0026rsquo;ve accumulated some experience with it on other projects. If I ever need to dig into its internals and fix something — it won\u0026rsquo;t be a big deal.\nHowever, choosing a theme is a different story entirely. Design, personal taste, creative agony — the choice is never easy. In the end, after reviewing quite a few options, I settled on Congo. Here are a few reasons.\nWhy Congo? #Fresh look. Sometimes you just want something new. The previous theme worked fine for me: it was clean and suited for documentation. But here I wanted more room for creativity. After all, this is meant to be half personal blog, even if with a professional slant.\nMultilingual support. Congo has first-class i18n support with per-language config files. I try to build multilingual support into all of my projects — it helps me maintain and practice my English. Besides — who knows what region or audience this project might reach in the future?\nDark theme out of the box. Congo\u0026rsquo;s default dark appearance leans into deep violet tones — and that happens to match the mood I\u0026rsquo;m in right now.\nMascot idea #I have an idea for a project mascot — a catgirl sorceress. Purple hair, dark violet robes and a druid\u0026rsquo;s hood with glowing pink eyes peeking out from underneath. A magic staff in hand, bearing Sigil Gate\u0026rsquo;s signature symbols (I have a few ideas on how to use it as a logo). Purely a concept for now, but it fits the vibe. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about the project\u0026rsquo;s visual identity: dark purple and blue on a white background, with bright pops of red-pink and cyan-blue as accents (a proper brand book is on the to-do list).\nExamples of Congo in the wild #If you want to see what the theme looks like on real sites:\nCongo demo — the official theme demo leif.io — personal site and tech blog antoinesoetewey.com — personal site major.io — personal site and blog softwarewitchcraft.com — personal blog gorbe.io — business site and blog You can find the full list of sites using Congo on the theme\u0026rsquo;s users page.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/choosing-a-theme-for-the-sigil-gate-project/","section":"Blog","summary":"Congo as the site theme — choosing, installing, and explaining why.","title":"Choosing a theme for the Sigil Gate project"},{"content":"SigilGate is an open-source project building tools for private networks that are resistant to blocking and traffic analysis.\nWe develop configuration templates, setup guides, and utilities that help circumvent restrictions and maintain free access to the internet.\nPrinciples # Openness.
