Dark mode, language switching, navigation — nothing broke, and it all looks clean and modern.\nOne small detail #There\u0026rsquo;s something that has always puzzled me: why do the vast majority of themes default to left-aligned text? The right edge of paragraphs ends up ragged, and it looks sloppy — especially on wide screens where the lines are long and the unevenness is hard to miss.\nJustified text makes everything feel tighter and more intentional — like a book or a well-typeset magazine. Sure, justify has its quirks with hyphenation, but for a blog with reasonable line lengths it looks significantly better.\nHow we fixed it #Congo provides an assets/css/custom.css file for user styles — it\u0026rsquo;s loaded automatically and isn\u0026rsquo;t touched during theme updates. A single rule is all it takes:\n.prose { text-align: justify; } Done. Text is now justified, and the next Congo update won\u0026rsquo;t break anything.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/first-impressions-of-the-new-theme/","section":"Blog","summary":"Congo works great out of the box, but one small detail needed a manual fix.","title":"First impressions of the new theme"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"Building tunnels, bridging gaps, connecting countries and continents.\nLearn more...

A few reasons behind the change.\nWhy Congo? #Fresh look. Sometimes you just want something new. Compose served us well, but we felt like trying a different aesthetic direction.\nMultilingual support. Congo has first-class i18n support with per-language config files. As the project grows, we want the site to be accessible in more than one language.\nDark purple palette. Congo\u0026rsquo;s default dark appearance leans into deep violet tones — and that happens to match the mood we\u0026rsquo;re going for. We\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about the project\u0026rsquo;s visual identity: dark purple and blue on a white background, with bright pops of red-pink and cyan-blue as accents.\nMascot idea #We\u0026rsquo;re also toying with the idea of a project mascot — a catgirl sorceress in dark violet robes, wearing a druid\u0026rsquo;s hood with glowing pink eyes peeking out from underneath, holding a magic staff. Purely a concept for now, but it fits the vibe. A proper brand book is on the to-do list.\nExamples of Congo in the wild #If you want to see what the theme looks like on real sites:\nCongo demo — the official theme demo leif.io — personal site and tech blog antoinesoetewey.com — personal site major.io — personal site and blog softwarewitchcraft.com — personal blog gorbe.io — business site and blog You can find the full list of sites using Congo on the theme\u0026rsquo;s users page.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/switching-to-congo/","section":"Blog","summary":"We switched our site theme from Compose to Congo — here\u0026rsquo;s why.","title":"Switching to Congo"},{"content":"SigilGate is an open-source project building tools for private networks that are resistant to blocking and traffic analysis.\nWe develop configuration templates, setup guides, and utilities that help circumvent restrictions and maintain free access to the internet.\nPrinciples # Openness.
