Dark mode, language switching, navigation — nothing broke, and it all looks clean and stylish.\nOne small detail #There\u0026rsquo;s something that has always puzzled me: why do the vast majority of themes default to left-aligned text? Why? Just\u0026hellip; why?! Oh, for the love of — my inner perfectionist suffers every time I see a crisp edge on the left and a ragged, uneven zigzag of line endings on the right. What\u0026rsquo;s stopping us from setting proper rules and boundaries for text blocks? It looks really sloppy — especially on wide screens where the lines are long and the unevenness is hard to miss.\nJustified text makes everything feel tighter and more intentional — like a book or a well-typeset magazine. Sure, justify has its quirks with hyphenation, but\u0026hellip; justified alignment is undoubtedly my choice.\nHow to fix it #Congo provides an assets/css/custom.css file for user styles — it\u0026rsquo;s loaded automatically and isn\u0026rsquo;t touched during theme updates. A single rule is all it takes:\n.prose { text-align: justify; } Done. Text is now justified, and the next Congo update won\u0026rsquo;t break anything.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/first-impressions-of-the-new-theme/","section":"Blog","summary":"Congo works great out of the box, but\u0026hellip;","title":"First impressions of the new theme"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"Building tunnels, bridging gaps, connecting countries and continents.\nLearn more...

Hugo, of course — minimalist and fast. I\u0026rsquo;ve accumulated some experience with it on other projects. If I ever need to dig into its internals and fix something — it won\u0026rsquo;t be a big deal.\nHowever, choosing a theme is a different story entirely. Design, personal taste, creative agony — the choice is never easy. In the end, after reviewing quite a few options, I settled on Congo. Here are a few reasons.\nWhy Congo? #Fresh look. Sometimes you just want something new. The previous theme worked fine for me: it was clean and suited for documentation. But here I wanted more room for creativity. After all, this is meant to be half personal blog, even if with a professional slant.\nMultilingual support. Congo has first-class i18n support with per-language config files. I try to build multilingual support into all of my projects — it helps me maintain and practice my English. Besides — who knows what region or audience this project might reach in the future?\nDark theme out of the box. Congo\u0026rsquo;s default dark appearance leans into deep violet tones — and that happens to match the mood I\u0026rsquo;m in right now.\nMascot idea #I have an idea for a project mascot — a catgirl sorceress. Purple hair, dark violet robes and a druid\u0026rsquo;s hood with glowing pink eyes peeking out from underneath. A magic staff in hand, bearing Sigil Gate\u0026rsquo;s signature symbols (I have a few ideas on how to use it as a logo). Purely a concept for now, but it fits the vibe. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about the project\u0026rsquo;s visual identity: dark purple and blue on a white background, with bright pops of red-pink and cyan-blue as accents (a proper brand book is on the to-do list).\nExamples of Congo in the wild #If you want to see what the theme looks like on real sites:\nCongo demo — the official theme demo leif.io — personal site and tech blog antoinesoetewey.com — personal site major.io — personal site and blog softwarewitchcraft.com — personal blog gorbe.io — business site and blog You can find the full list of sites using Congo on the theme\u0026rsquo;s users page.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/choosing-a-theme-for-the-sigil-gate-project/","section":"Blog","summary":"Congo as the site theme — choosing, installing, and explaining why.","title":"Choosing a theme for the Sigil Gate project"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/linux/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linux"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/tags/systemd/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Systemd"},{"content":"I feel like a caveman.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been around for a while, and there are things I\u0026rsquo;ve grown so accustomed to that I treat them as constants. They\u0026rsquo;re always in their place. They always work. I never wonder if there\u0026rsquo;s something else — because why would I, if everything\u0026rsquo;s fine as it is?\nWhen I need to run something on a regular schedule — I use cron. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how old this utility is. It feels like it\u0026rsquo;s been around forever. Open crontab -e, write a schedule, forget about it. It works.\nBut today, while solving yet another periodic task, I was surprised to discover that an alternative exists. And has existed for quite some time.\nSystemd timer is a task scheduling mechanism built into systemd. It solves the same problems as cron, but with greater precision and more options:\nSecond-level granularity. Cron\u0026rsquo;s minimum interval is one minute. Systemd timer has no such limitation. No duplicate runs. If the previous run hasn\u0026rsquo;t finished yet, a new one won\u0026rsquo;t start. Cron doesn\u0026rsquo;t control this: if a script runs longer than the interval, a second instance launches on top of the first. Logging via journalctl. All runs, outputs, errors — in one place. No need to manually redirect stdout to a file. RandomizedDelaySec. Random delay for the start time. The task doesn\u0026rsquo;t fire exactly on schedule — it starts at a random moment within a defined window. This makes timing patterns harder to detect — useful when predictability is undesirable. Dependencies. You can specify that a task should only run after the network is up, after another service has started, after a disk is mounted. Cron just fires on schedule, regardless of system state (or you have to cobble together your own workarounds). Persistent. If the system was off when a scheduled run was due, the task runs immediately after boot. Cron simply loses missed runs. Recently I needed to set up automatic rotation of randomly generated gRPC paths between nodes. I could have used cron for this. But\u0026hellip; I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to leave the cave.\nNow that I know about systemd timer, here\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s on the agenda:\nSet up monitoring via journalctl — alerts on rotation errors, log aggregation. Fine-tune the random delay — to make statistical analysis of rotation timing even harder for detection systems. Network dependency — don\u0026rsquo;t attempt rotation if the network hasn\u0026rsquo;t come up yet after a reboot. And possibly more things that systemd timer can do and cron can\u0026rsquo;t. I suspect I\u0026rsquo;ve only scratched the surface.
