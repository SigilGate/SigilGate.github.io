The technical solutions have been found. We went through protocol experiments, node configuration, searching for working combinations — and ended up with an infrastructure that does what it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to: bypasses blocks, passes through DPI, and keeps communication running.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s already a win. But during the prototyping phase, I ran into a problem. I was dumping everything into one pile: credentials, scripts, documentation, research, notes. All in one place — convenient for a quick start, but death for growing and scaling the project. A messy structure, blurred boundaries, heaps of information going stale.\nIt became obvious: time to break this monolith apart.\nCreating the organization #I created a separate organization on GitHub to split everything into specialized repositories. Data — separate. Management scripts — separate. Guides — separate from credentials. Some things will stay private, some will go public.\nRight now I\u0026rsquo;m focused on migrating the documentation. The Docs section on the site has started filling up. I\u0026rsquo;m gradually pulling content from the private repository: node type descriptions, topology, basic principles. This is just the beginning — some areas still need polishing, a lot of it still looks rough and needs reworking, but the process is underway.\nThe Docs section #For an open-source project, documentation is the foundation. Good documentation means architectural transparency. It means navigation across the organization\u0026rsquo;s repositories. It means any visitor can understand at first glance where they\u0026rsquo;ve landed and how everything is structured.\nThis matters for potential contributors, for future followers, and for anyone who\u0026rsquo;s expressed interest and simply stopped by to look. Documentation is the entry point and the first impression.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s another aspect — less obvious, but no less important.\nI already wrote about this in the context of the About page: when you work closely with AI, it\u0026rsquo;s critically important to be able to quickly and precisely build context. Detailed, well-structured documentation that reflects the project\u0026rsquo;s current state lets you reduce that effort to a minimum: \u0026ldquo;Read the information on the website. Read the project documentation.\u0026rdquo;\nNow, in the age of AI, documentation takes on a new role — it becomes an interface for AI assistants. And the more accurately the documentation reflects the project\u0026rsquo;s state, the more efficient the context-building process becomes.\nSo — we\u0026rsquo;re clearing the backlog, putting everything in its place. Breaking the monolith apart.\nToday it\u0026rsquo;s documentation. Then credentials and the information storage system. Then automation and scripts, and after that we can start scaling. There\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of work ahead.\n","date":"4 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/the-docs-section/","section":"Sigil Gate Project Blog","summary":"The project works.

A placeholder — just enough information to keep the page from being empty. Fine for launching a site, but the project is growing, and it\u0026rsquo;s getting hard to describe in a few words.\nNow the section has been fully reworked. Instead of a short description — a detailed overview of the project, broken into several thematic blocks:\nAbout — what Sigil Gate is and why the project is partially open-source. Goals — a decentralized architecture resistant to detection, and practical plans. Mission — free access to information and an open community. Project Status — where we are now and where we grew from. Team — who\u0026rsquo;s behind the project. Contributing — how to get involved. Why bother #The motivation is very simple. The project is going public: a website, a blog, a Telegram channel. It\u0026rsquo;s open source, baby!\nThe About page is the first thing a person sees when they want to understand where they\u0026rsquo;ve landed. It should answer the basic questions: what is this, why does it exist, who\u0026rsquo;s behind it, and how can I get involved.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not just about people. There\u0026rsquo;s another, less obvious, side.\nWhen you work closely with AI, it\u0026rsquo;s very important to describe your project concisely, clearly, and in a structured way — outline its current state and development prospects. Set the boundaries and the rules. Provide the right context, place the right accents.\nThen the whole process of building context can be reduced to two sentences: \u0026ldquo;Read the information on the website. Read the project documentation.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next #Speaking of documentation. The plan is to move the architectural documentation from the private repository to a public Docs section on the website. General principles, topology descriptions, protocol internals — all of this should be open, accessible, clearly structured, and collected in one place.

They\u0026rsquo;re always in their place. They always work. I never wonder if there\u0026rsquo;s something else — because why would I, if everything\u0026rsquo;s fine as it is?\nWhen I need to run something on a regular schedule — I use cron. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how old this utility is. It feels like it\u0026rsquo;s been around forever. Open crontab -e, write a schedule, forget about it. It works.\nBut today, while solving yet another periodic task, I was surprised to discover that an alternative exists. And has existed for quite some time.\nSystemd timer is a task scheduling mechanism built into systemd. It solves the same problems as cron, but with greater precision and more options:\nSecond-level granularity. Cron\u0026rsquo;s minimum interval is one minute. Systemd timer has no such limitation. No duplicate runs. If the previous run hasn\u0026rsquo;t finished yet, a new one won\u0026rsquo;t start. Cron doesn\u0026rsquo;t control this: if a script runs longer than the interval, a second instance launches on top of the first. Logging via journalctl. All runs, outputs, errors — in one place. No need to manually redirect stdout to a file. RandomizedDelaySec. Random delay for the start time. The task doesn\u0026rsquo;t fire exactly on schedule — it starts at a random moment within a defined window. This makes timing patterns harder to detect — useful when predictability is undesirable. Dependencies. You can specify that a task should only run after the network is up, after another service has started, after a disk is mounted. Cron just fires on schedule, regardless of system state (or you have to cobble together your own workarounds). Persistent. If the system was off when a scheduled run was due, the task runs immediately after boot. Cron simply loses missed runs. Recently I needed to set up automatic rotation of randomly generated gRPC paths between nodes. I could have used cron for this. But\u0026hellip; I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to leave the cave.\nNow that I know about systemd timer, here\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s on the agenda:\nSet up monitoring via journalctl — alerts on rotation errors, log aggregation. Fine-tune the random delay — to make statistical analysis of rotation timing even harder for detection systems. Network dependency — don\u0026rsquo;t attempt rotation if the network hasn\u0026rsquo;t come up yet after a reboot. And possibly more things that systemd timer can do and cron can\u0026rsquo;t. I suspect I\u0026rsquo;ve only scratched the surface.

This is the cross-border channel: it crosses the perimeter where DPI systems focus their attention.\nVLESS over gRPC is a strong combination. The traffic is virtually indistinguishable from regular HTTPS: TLS with a valid certificate, HTTP/2, browser-like TLS fingerprint. From the outside, it looks like a request to an ordinary web service. Identifying it by signatures is practically impossible.\nBut \u0026ldquo;virtually indistinguishable\u0026rdquo; does not mean \u0026ldquo;impossible to detect.\u0026rdquo;\nEven when the traffic content is encrypted and the protocol is obfuscated, metadata remains: who, where, how often, how long. A persistent connection to the same gRPC path on the same host is a pattern. Even for a legitimate gRPC microservice, this looks suspicious — real services typically call different endpoints.\nIf the path doesn\u0026rsquo;t change for weeks, it becomes a marker. Statistical analysis can single out such a connection from the general traffic flow.\nThe solution: rotate the gRPC serviceName automatically at a set interval. Each new path is a randomly generated string. From the outside, it looks like activity from various services and users on the same host.\nI\u0026rsquo;d been putting off the implementation for a while, but today I finally got around to it.\nIn its minimal form, it\u0026rsquo;s a bash script on the core node, triggered by a systemd timer. The script generates a new random path, updates the Nginx and Xray configs on the core node, then pushes the outbound path change to each entry node over SSH.\nAn important detail: the client-facing side is not affected. The path is rotated only on the internal entry→core segment. Clients don\u0026rsquo;t need to reconfigure anything — they keep connecting to the entry node at the same address as before.\nCurrent limitations #For a few seconds during rotation, the connection may drop — services are restarted. The client reconnects automatically, but the interruption is noticeable.\nIn the future, we plan to switch to the Xray gRPC API (hot reload). This will allow path changes without restarting services — making the rotation seamless, with no connection drops.\nCurrently, rotation is set to run every hour. Practice will show whether this causes any noticeable inconvenience on the client side. If not, we\u0026rsquo;ll increase the interval or move rotation to periods of least activity.\n","date":"1 February 2026","permalink":"https://sigilgate.github.io/en/blog/%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-grpc-%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B9/","section":"Sigil Gate Project Blog","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s been on the roadmap for a while — and it\u0026rsquo;s finally done.
