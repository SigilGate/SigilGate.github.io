We've switched the SigilGate site from the Compose theme to [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo). A few reasons behind the change.

## Why Congo?

**Fresh look.** Sometimes you just want something new. Compose served us well, but we felt like trying a different aesthetic direction.

**Multilingual support.** Congo has first-class i18n support with per-language config files. As the project grows, we want the site to be accessible in more than one language.

**Dark purple palette.** Congo's default dark appearance leans into deep violet tones — and that happens to match the mood we're going for. We've been thinking about the project's visual identity: dark purple and blue on a white background, with bright pops of red-pink and cyan-blue as accents.

## Mascot idea

We're also toying with the idea of a project mascot — a catgirl sorceress in dark violet robes, wearing a druid's hood with glowing pink eyes peeking out from underneath, holding a magic staff. Purely a concept for now, but it fits the vibe. A proper brand book is on the to-do list.
