Today I didn't do anything useful, but I completely reworked the About section.

Up until today it was a three-sentence page: Sigil Gate, principles, and a couple of links. A placeholder — just enough information to keep the page from being empty. Fine for launching a site, but the project is growing, and it's getting hard to describe in a few words.

Now the section has been fully reworked. Instead of a short description — a detailed overview of the project, broken into several thematic blocks:

- **About** — what Sigil Gate is and why the project is partially open-source.
- **Goals** — a decentralized architecture resistant to detection, and practical plans.
- **Mission** — free access to information and an open community.
- **Project Status** — where we are now and where we grew from.
- **Team** — who's behind the project.
- **Contributing** — how to get involved.

## Why bother

The motivation is very simple. The project is going public: a website, a blog, a Telegram channel. It's open source, baby!

The About page is the first thing a person sees when they want to understand where they've landed. It should answer the basic questions: what is this, why does it exist, who's behind it, and how can I get involved.

And it's not just about people. There's another, less obvious, side.

When you work closely with AI, it's **very important** to describe your project concisely, clearly, and in a structured way — outline its current state and development prospects. Set the boundaries and the rules. Provide the right context, place the right accents.

Then the whole process of building context can be reduced to two sentences: "Read the information on the website. Read the project documentation."

## What's next

Speaking of documentation. The plan is to move the architectural documentation from the private repository to a public Docs section on the website. General principles, topology descriptions, protocol internals — all of this should be open, accessible, clearly structured, and collected in one place. But that's the next step.
