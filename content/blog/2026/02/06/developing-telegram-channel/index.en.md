I listen to criticism and try to take it all constructively.

I agree that reading posts via links in the channel probably isn't the most convenient experience. It's probably worth keeping that format for announcements, and just as a way to periodically remind people about the main blog and redirect them to the site.

At the end of the day, the Telegram channel is a separate story. I decided to branch off a dedicated Telegram branch and store content there in this specific format.

Longer posts will be condensed, the delivery will lean more toward dialogue and discussion, more emojis, and the formatting quirks will need to be accounted for too (Telegram uses its own subset of Markdown, or you can use HTML).

I'll give it a try and see how it goes.
