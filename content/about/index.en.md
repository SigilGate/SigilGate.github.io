**SigilGate** is a project focused on building private networks resistant to deep packet inspection (DPI), active probing, and regional blocking.

The project is **partially open-source**. We publish general architectural principles, general-purpose tools, and share our experience in the [blog](/blog/). At the same time, a significant part of the project remains closed: node configurations, sensitive infrastructure data, and specific organizational details are not intended for public access.

That said, we are open to dialogue with the community and willing to discuss:

- private network topology design;
- architectural approaches to traffic obfuscation;
- protocol and transport internals;
- threat models and vulnerabilities of private networks;
- DPI and active probing defense techniques.

We also aim to open-source general-purpose tools for monitoring, automation, and system administration.

## Goals

### Strategic Goals

Building a decentralized network infrastructure that:

- is resistant to detection by Deep Packet Inspection systems and active probing;
- disguises traffic as legitimate HTTPS activity across all network segments;
- remains operational when individual nodes are blocked or compromised;
- scales and adapts to changing conditions.

### Practical Objectives

The primary objective is to deploy a private network, built on the principles described in the project, for a limited group of users.

Looking ahead:

- commercial application of the accumulated experience and expertise;
- independent services for designing and configuring secure networks;
- consulting in network security and infrastructure solutions;
- development of tools and platforms based on the described architecture.

## Mission

Beyond its technical goals, the project carries a social mission.

We believe that free access to information is a fundamental right. Internet restrictions affect millions of people, and we want to contribute to solving this problem.

Our values:

- **Freedom of information.** Access to knowledge and resources should not depend on geography or political climate.
- **Openness.** We share our experience, research, and tools so that everyone can benefit from the accumulated knowledge.
- **Privacy.** Infrastructure belongs to its users. No logs, no tracking.

We strive to build a community where people can freely discuss internet restriction issues, exchange experience, and collaborate on solutions.

## Project Status

The project is in the **early stages of active development**. SigilGate grew out of several pet projects related to building private networks for personal use, and is now taking shape as a standalone project with long-term goals.

The core infrastructure is deployed and operational. Work is ongoing on documentation, automation tools, and network expansion.

## Team

Currently, the project is developed by a single maintainer — [A1eksMa](https://github.com/A1eksMa).

AI assistants help with the project: [Claude](https://claude.ai/) by Anthropic and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) by Google.

We welcome anyone who wants to join the project — in any role and at any level of involvement.

## Contributing

There are several ways to get involved:
