**Sigil Gate** is a project focused on building private networks resistant to deep packet inspection (DPI), active probing, and regional blocking.

**Sigil Gate** is a **partially open-source** project. We openly publish general architecture, general-purpose tools, and share our experience in the [blog](/blog/). At the same time, a significant part of the project remains closed: node configurations, sensitive infrastructure data, and specific organizational details are not intended for public access.

That said, we are open to dialogue with the community and willing to discuss:

- architectural approaches to private network design;
- protocol and transport internals;
- threat models and vulnerabilities of private networks;
- DPI and active probing defense techniques.

We also aim to open-source general-purpose tools for monitoring, automation, and system administration.

## Goals

### Strategic Goals

Building a decentralized network architecture that:

- is resistant to detection;
- disguises traffic as legitimate HTTPS activity across all network segments;
- remains operational when individual nodes are blocked or compromised;
- scales and adapts to changing conditions.

### Practical Objectives

The primary objective is to deploy infrastructure for a private network, built on the described principles, for a limited group of participants.

Looking ahead:

- commercial application of the accumulated experience and expertise;
- independent services for designing and configuring secure networks;
- consulting in network security and infrastructure solutions;
- development of tools and platforms based on the described architecture.

## Mission

Beyond its technical goals and objectives, the project carries a social mission. We believe in the value of free access to open information. Internet restrictions affect the interests of millions of people worldwide, and we want to contribute to solving this problem. We strive to build an open community for free discussion of restriction issues, experience sharing, and collaborative problem-solving.

## Project Status

The project is in the **early stages of active development**. Sigil Gate grew out of several pet projects related to building private networks for personal use, and is now taking shape as a standalone project with long-term goals.

The core infrastructure is deployed and operational. Work is ongoing on documentation, automation tools, and network expansion.
