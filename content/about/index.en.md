**SigilGate** is an open-source project building tools for private networks that are resistant to blocking and traffic analysis.

We develop configuration templates, setup guides, and utilities that help circumvent restrictions and maintain free access to the internet.

## Principles

- **Openness.** Source code and documentation are publicly available.
- **Privacy.** No logs, no tracking. Infrastructure belongs to its users.
- **Resilience.** Architecture designed to withstand DPI and other blocking methods.
